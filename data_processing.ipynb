       " 'i like that because once i had no published novels and roughly two hundred ideas about the art and craft of writing fiction (two hundred and fifty on a good day).',\n",
       " 'now i have just about fifty published novels to my credit and only one surviving idea about fiction; a writing seminar as taught by yours truly would probably last about fifteen minutes.',\n",
       " \"one of the ideas i had in those good old days was that it would be perfectly possible to combine the overlord-vampire myth from bram stoker's dracula with the naturalistic fiction of frank norris and the ec horror comics i'd loved as a child…and come out with a great american novel.\",\n",
       " 'i was twenty-three, remember, so cut me a break.',\n",
       " 'i had a teaching certificate upon which the ink had hardly dried, i had published eight short stories and i had a perfectly insane amount of confidence in my own ability, not to mention a totally ridiculous sense of my own importance.',\n",
       " 'i also had a wife with a typewriter who liked my stories—and those last two things, which i took for granted then, turned out to be the most important things of all.',\n",

       " 'i did.',\n",
       " 'i really did.',\n",
       " 'i even planned a section at the front called “extracta,” where i would include notes, clippings, and epigrams about vampires, as melville does about whales at the front of his book.',\n",
       " \"was i daunted by the fact that moby-dick only sold about twelve copies in melville's lifetime?\",\n",
       " 'not i; one of my ideas was that a novelist takes the long view, the lofty view, and that does not include the price of eggs.',\n",
       " '(my wife would not have agreed, and i doubt if mrs. melville would have, either.)',\n",
       " \"in any case, i liked the idea of my vampire novel serving as a balance for stoker's, which has to go down in history as the most optimistic scary novel of all time.\",\n",
       " 'count dracula, simultaneously feared and worshipped in his dark little european fiefdom of transylvania, makes the fatal mistake of taking his act and putting it on the road.',\n",
       " 'in london he meets men and women of science and reason, by god—abraham van helsing, who knows about blood transfusions; john seward, who keeps his diary on wax phonograph cylinders; mina harker, who keeps hers in shorthand and later serves as secretary to the fearless vampire hunters.',\n",
       " \"stoker was clearly fascinated by modern inventions and innovations, and the underlying thesis of his novel is clear: in a confrontation between a foreign child of the dark powers and a group of fine, upstanding britishers equipped with all mod cons, the powers of darkness don't stand a chance.\",\n",
       " 'dracula is hounded from carfax, his british estate, back to transylvania, and finally staked at sunset.',\n",
       " \"the vampire-hunters pay a price for their victory—that is stoker's genius—but that they will come out on top is never in much doubt.\",\n",
       " 'when i sat down to write my version of the story in 1972—a version whose life-force was drawn more from the nervously jokey jewish-american mythos of william gaines and al feldstein than from romanian folk-tales—i saw a different world, one where all of the gadgets stoker must have regarded with such hopeful wonder had begun to seem sinister and downright dangerous.',\n",
       " 'mine was the world that had begun to choke on its own effluent, that had hooked itself through the bag on diminishing energy resources, and had to deal not only with nuclear weapons but nuclear proliferation (big-time terrorism was, thankfully, at that time still over the horizon).',\n",
       " 'i saw myself and my society at the other end of the technological rainbow, and set out to write a book that would reflect that glum idea.',\n",
       " 'one where, in short, the vampire would end up eating the fearless vampire-hunters for lunch.',\n",
       " '(which he, as a vampire, would eat at midnight, of course.)',\n",
       " 'i was about three hundred pages into this book—then titled second coming—when carrie was published, and my first idea about novel-writing went west.',\n",
       " \"it would be years before i would hear alfred bester's axiom “the book is the boss,” but i didn't need to; i learned it for myself writing the novel that eventually became 'salem's lot.\",\n",
       " \"of course, the writer can impose control; it's just a really shitty idea.\",\n",
       " 'writing controlled fiction is called “plotting.” buckling your seatbelt and letting the story take over, however…that is called “storytelling.” storytelling is as natural as breathing; plotting is the literary version of artificial respiration.',\n",
       " 'given my dim view of small new england towns (i had grown up in one and knew what they were like), i had no doubt my version of count dracula would emerge completely triumphant over the puny representatives of the rational world arrayed against him.',\n",
       " \"what i didn't count on was that my characters weren't content to remain puny representatives.\",\n",
       " 'instead they came alive and began to do things—sometimes smart things, sometimes foolishly brave things—on their own.',\n",
       " \"more of stoker's characters are around at the finish of dracula than at the end of 'salem's lot, and yet this is—against its young author's will—a surprisingly optimistic book.\",\n",
       " \"i'm glad.\",\n",
       " 'i still see all the nicks and dings on its fenders, all the scars on its hide that were inflicted by the inexperience of a craftsman new at his trade, but i still find many passages of power here.',\n",
       " 'and a few of grace.',\n",
       " 'doubleday had published my first novel, and had an option on my second.',\n",

       " 'i showed them both to my then-editor, bill thompson.',\n",
       " 'he liked them both.',\n",
       " 'we had a lunch at which nothing was decided, then started to walk back to doubleday.',\n",
       " \"at the corner of park avenue and 54th street—something like that—we were stopped by a don't walk light.\",\n",
       " 'i finally pulled the pin and asked bill which one he thought we should publish.',\n",
       " 'he said, “roadwork would probably get more serious attention, but second coming is peyton place with vampires.',\n",
       " \"it's a great read and it could be a bestseller.\",\n",
       " \"there's only one problem.”\\n\\n“what's that?” i asked, as don't walk changed to walk and people started to move around us.\",\n",
       " 'bill stepped off the curb.',\n",
       " \"in new york you don't waste the walk, even when decisions of moment are being made, and this—i might have sensed it even then—was one that would affect the rest of my life.\",\n",
